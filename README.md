# Summary

This is a Odin Project assignment for Web Development 101; Project: HTML/CSS. The goal is to copy the Google homepage so it looks identical (it does not have to function 100%; the goal is basic design).
***

## After-action:

1. I feel confident in basic Git workflow and terminal commands.

2. Right from the beginning, I had to look at other student projects in order to get started. The HTML was rather straight-forward, but CSS was a huge pain. I wanted to style on my own, but I ended up Googling a lot of stuff (I attempted CSS Grids, with little success).

3. I am using **VS Code** (rather than a text editor) and there were some learning obstacles associated with that. 
	- I have discovered some of the add-ins to be useful, but possibly a crutch (snippets, auto-complete, etc.)
	- Ctrl + Shift + i automatically formats the code, which is very useful and it shows me how I should be formatting.

4. I disregarded the instructions and tried to be a perfectionist, and it only led to frustration. I spent 80% of my time working on the final 10% of code to align items. I eventually decided what I had was 'good enough' as I spent far too long on this lesson.

5. For anyone reading this and working through this project: what worked best for me was:
	- Layout your basic HTML structure; use comments as placeholders (same w/ CSS). 
	- Setup your file directory, and insert the links in the html head.
	- Use a CSS reset stylesheet (test it out as well; I wrote my html and a very basic stylesheet, and then when I linked to a separate reset stylesheet, it made a lot of changes).
	- You can style the entire page w/o grid/flexbox, but it is worth the time to experiment (just don't get sucked in like I did).
	- Organize your CSS with comments.

6. Formatting this README has been a  PITA :angry:. Go [HERE](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#lists) for syntax.

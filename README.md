This is a Odin Project assignment for Web Development 101; Project: HTML/CSS. The goal is to copy the Google homepage so it looks identical (it does not have to function 100%, the goal is basic design).


After-action:
1. I feel confident in basic Git workflow and terminal commands.
2. Right from the beginning, I had to look at other student projects in order to get started, but once I had code on the screen, I only had to reference my notes and use trial and error for the CSS layout.
3. I am using VS Code (rather than a text editor) and there were some learning obstacles associated with that.
	a. I have discoverd some of the add-ins to be useful, but possibly a crutch (snippets, auto-complete, etc.)
	b. Ctrl + Shift + i automatically formats the code, which is very useful and it shows me how I should be formatting.
4. This is my first project, and the problem-solving process was enjoyable (and is what drew me to programming in the first place).
5. For anyone reading this and working through this project: what worked best for me was:
	a. Layout your basic HTML structure; use comments as placeholders. EX: <!--I will put the Google logo here, it will not be a working link-->
	b. Setup your directory, and insert the links in the html head.
	c. Use a CSS reset stylesheet (test it out as well; I wrote my html and a very basic stylesheet, and then when I linked to a separate reset stylesheet, it made a lot of changes).
	d. You can style the entire page w/o grid/flexbox, but it is worth the time to experiment.
	e. Organize your CSS with comments /*your comment*/
6. It is important to code at least 30min a day, and to push commits (the heatmap, yo!).
